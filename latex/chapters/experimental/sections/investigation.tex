\section{Further Investigations}

Further analysis could involve:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculating the average percentage of energy loss per period for a more precise quantification of the energy dissipation rate.
	\item Repeating the measurements with different pendulum parameters (e.g., bob mass, string length) to investigate the influence of these factors on energy conservation.
	\item Comparing the experimental results with theoretical models that incorporate air resistance and other non-idealities to improve the accuracy of predictions for real-world pendulums.
\end{itemize}

By acknowledging and analysing the departure from ideal energy conservation, we gain a deeper understanding of the real-world dynamics of pendulums and their interactions with the environment.

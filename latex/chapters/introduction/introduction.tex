\chapter{Introduction}

In this project, we have investigated the oscillations of a simple pendulum, with the primary goal of measuring the period of oscillation. The theoretical and experimental aspects of the pendulum's motion were explored, focusing on the relationship between variables like angle, energy, and period.

\bigskip

We have considered the string massless, which means all the mass comes from the bob of the pendulum. Also, we have thought everything in an ideal environment such that there is no air resistance etc.

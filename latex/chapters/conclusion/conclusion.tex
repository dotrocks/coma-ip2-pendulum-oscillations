\chapter{Conclusion}

Our investigation into the oscillations of a simple pendulum has unveiled a fascinating interplay between theoretical predictions and real-world complexities. While the idealized model based on Eq. (3) provides a valuable framework, we discovered that real pendulums deviate from this perfect scenario due to various factors. Air resistance, joint friction, non-ideal string mass, and non-linear restoring forces all contribute to departures from the simple harmonic motion model.

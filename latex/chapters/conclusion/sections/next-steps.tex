\section{Next Steps}

Our exploration opens doors for further investigations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Quantifying the average energy loss per period to accurately assess the impact of dissipative forces.
	\item Experimenting with different pendulum parameters (e.g., bob mass, string length) to analyse their influence on energy conservation.
	\item Comparing experimental results with more sophisticated models that incorporate non-idealities to improve the accuracy of predictions for real-world pendulums.
\end{itemize}

By delving deeper into the intricacies of the real pendulum, we gain not only a richer understanding of its motion but also valuable insights into the diverse factors that shape the behaviour of seemingly simple systems in the real world. This journey demonstrates the importance of embracing complexity and exploring beyond idealized models to unlock the true dynamics of the world around us.

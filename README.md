# Integrated Project#2 - Studying the Pendulum Oscillations

Project files for the second integrated project of the COMA Capsule at Abdullah Gül University, Fall 2023.

In this project, we have investigated the oscillations of a simple pendulum, with the primary goal of measuring the period of oscillation. The theoretical and experimental aspects of the pendulum's motion were explored, focusing on the relationship between variables like angle, energy, and period.

This project consists of 3 parts:

1. **MATH153 & PHYS105**: Theoretical and experimental calculations of a simple pendulum system.
2. **MATH103**: Mathematical modeling of the pendulum motion using matrices and vectors.
3. **EE101**: Checking the number of questions answered correctly in a quiz using data from a CSV file.

Code for EE101 part: <https://gist.github.com/barbarbar338/93e2c86cb307a650225463a3310bf1ff>

**NOTE:** Please note that the calculations on the report may not be accurate, as the project was done in my freshman year and I was not very familiar with the concepts at that time. I want to keep this project as a reference for my future self and for anyone who may find it useful.
